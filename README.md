## Introduction
The goal of this test is to demonstrate your ability to deploy an application using AWS services, ensuring security, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Running Locally
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/josemosquerasymplifica/symplificaAppsTest.git
    cd symplificaAppsTest
    ```

2. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. The application should now be running locally. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
